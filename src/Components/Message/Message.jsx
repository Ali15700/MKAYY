       As the clock ticks away the last moments of the year, my heart swells with gratitude and love for you. As I reflect on the past months, I can't help but marvel at the incredible journey we've shared together. It feels like just yesterday when we first met on that warm July day, and little did I know that our encounter would mark the beginning of a beautiful chapter in both our lives.

      Our walks, filled with laughter and shared secrets, have become the foundation of the bond we cherish so dearly. The joy of roasting, our shared favorite, has brought us countless moments of warmth and connection. You are, without a doubt, everything to me my confidante, my joy, and my heart's truest companion.

      The date on which we first met is etched in my memory as a reminder of the day my world became infinitely better. I still vividly remember picking you up from university, eagerly awaiting the end of your classes just to spend those precious moments together. Those times, filled with anticipation and shared dreams, are eternally etched in my heart.

      Our possessiveness, a testament to the depth of our connection, only reaffirms the strength of our love. The way we give and receive gifts, each one a symbol of our thoughtfulness and affection, speaks volumes about the care we invest in one another. Through thick and thin, we've stood by each other, offering unwavering support and love, making every obstacle seem conquerable.

      Life is a canvas, and with you, every stroke is filled with vibrant colors. Without you, it would be a monochrome existence, unattractive and devoid of the happiness you bring. In your arms, I've found solace, and in your eyes, I see a future filled with endless possibilities.

      <br></br>
      <p className="message-paragraph">
      Being your Spongy has been my greatest joy, just as you being my Patsy is my greatest pride. Your overthinking mind, which I adore so much, has made me a patient listener and an overexplainer, yet it's a small price to pay for the incredible moments we share. I want you to know that I'll always be with you, through every challenge and triumph, holding you close and cherishing the love that binds us.

     Reading "Him & I," a tale where I am Zephyrus, the beast, and you, my dearest Seraphina, the princess. May the pages of our story be filled with enchantment, passion, and a love that transcends the realms of fantasy.

     As we step into the new year, my wish is simple to continue building a life brimming with love, laughter, and countless beautiful memories with you. Happy New Year, my love, and here's to many more chapters in our extraordinary journey together.
